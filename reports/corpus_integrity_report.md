# Corpus Integrity Report

**Date:** January 8, 2026
**Generated by:** Gemini CLI Agent

## 1. Overview
This report documents the validation and integrity audit of the source materials provided for the Universal Context Protocol (UCP) project. The corpus consists of OCR'd Markdown files derived from research papers and extracted documentation from GitHub repositories.

## 2. Research Papers (OCR'd Markdown)

### Validated & Relevant
The following documents have been verified as relevant to the UCP project and contain intact, readable content (though some are summaries).

*   **2210.03629v3.md (ReAct):**
    *   **Status:** Valid.
    *   **Content:** Full paper text on "ReAct: Synergizing Reasoning and Acting in Language Models".
    *   **Relevance:** High. Core concept for agentic reasoning.

*   **2302.04761v1.md (Toolformer):**
    *   **Status:** Valid.
    *   **Content:** Paper on "Toolformer: Language Models That Can Teach Themselves to Use Tools".
    *   **Relevance:** High. Foundation for tool usage.

*   **2305.15334v1.md (Gorilla):**
    *   **Status:** Valid (Summary).
    *   **Content:** A structured summary/digest of "Gorilla: Large Language Model Connected with Massive APIs". It is not the full raw OCR but contains all key sections (Abstract, Intro, Methodology, Evaluation).
    *   **Relevance:** High. Direct reference for API/Tool fine-tuning.

*   **2307.16789v2.md (Retooling LLMs / ToolLLM):**
    *   **Status:** Valid.
    *   **Content:** Content matches "Retooling LLMs: Generation with Integrated Document Retrieval and Tool-use".
    *   **Relevance:** High. Relevant for integrated retrieval and tool use.

*   **2402.01159v2.md (UFO):**
    *   **Status:** Valid.
    *   **Content:** Paper on "UFO: A UI-Focused Agent for Windows OS Interaction".
    *   **Relevance:** Medium/High. Good reference for OS-level context and action planning.

### Corrupted / Mislabeled / Irrelevant

*   **2310.11511v1.md (CRITICAL MISMATCH):**
    *   **Status:** **Corrupted/Mislabeled.**
    *   **Issue:** The file content describes "Self-Route: Relying on LLMs to Route Queries...". However, the ArXiv ID 2310.11511 corresponds to **MemGPT**.
    *   **Resolution:** A separate file docs/2310.11511v1_MemGPT.md was found in the corpus which correctly contains the MemGPT paper. The system should rely on 2310.11511v1_MemGPT.md for MemGPT concepts. The "Self-Route" content in 2310.11511v1.md appears to be a hallucination or a misnamed file from a different source.
    *   **Action Taken:** Flagged docs/pdfs/2310.11511v1.md as unreliable. Will use docs/2310.11511v1_MemGPT.md for analysis.

*   **2403.03572v1.md (Hyperuniform Point Sets):**
    *   **Status:** **Irrelevant.**
    *   **Content:** Mathematical paper on "Hyperuniform Point Sets on Projective Spaces".
    *   **Action:** Excluded from UCP synthesis. Noise file.

*   **2405.12166v1.md (Stokes-Transport Equation):**
    *   **Status:** **Irrelevant.**
    *   **Content:** Physics/Math paper on fluid dynamics.
    *   **Action:** Excluded from UCP synthesis. Noise file.

## 3. Repository Documentation

The extracted documentation for the following repositories appears complete and consistent with the directory structures found:

*   **Gorilla:** Docs cover APIBench, RAFT, and the leaderboard.
*   **LangGraph:** Docs cover the graph-based orchestration, state management, and multi-agent workflows.
*   **LlamaIndex:** Docs cover the core indexing, retrieval, and storage modules.

## 4. Summary of Actions
1.  **Validation:** All PDF markdown files were read and checked against their actual content and ArXiv IDs.
2.  **Filtering:** Identified 2 noise papers and 1 mislabeled paper.
3.  **Substitution:** Designated docs/2310.11511v1_MemGPT.md as the authoritative source for MemGPT, replacing the corrupted 2310.11511v1.md.

**The corpus is now considered validated and ready for the Codebase Audit and UCP Design phases, subject to the exclusions noted above.**
