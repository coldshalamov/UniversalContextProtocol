HYPERUNIFORM POINT SETS ON PROJECTIVE SPACES

JOHANN S. BRAUCHART AND PETER J. GRABNER

ABSTRACT. We extend the notion of hyperuniformity to the projective spaces RPd−1, CPd−1, HPd−1, and OP2. We show that hyperuniformity implies uniform distribution and present examples of deterministic point sets as well as point processes which exhibit hyperuniform behaviour.

1. INTRODUCTION
The quantitative characterisation of density fluctuation in many-particle systems led to the introduction of the concept of “hyperuniformity” (S. Torquato; cf. [37]) also called “superhomogeneity” (J. Lebowitz, cf. [18]).
The main feature of hyperuniformity of an infinite discrete point configuration X in Rd is the fact that local density fluctuations are of smaller order than for a random (“Poissonian”) point configuration. In terms of the structure factor...
