ASYMPTOTIC STABILITY OF THE TWO-DIMENSIONAL COUETTE FLOW FOR THE STOKES-TRANSPORT EQUATION IN A FINITE CHANNEL

DANIEL SINAMBELA, WEIREN ZHAO, AND RUIZHAO ZI

ABSTRACT. We study the Stokes-transport system in a two-dimensional channel with horizontally moving boundaries, which serves as a reduced model for oceanography and sedimentation. The density is transported by the velocity field, satisfying the momentum balance between viscosity, pressure, and gravity effects, described by the Stokes equation at any given time. Due to the presence of moving boundaries, stratified densities with the Couette flow constitute one class of steady states. In this paper, we investigate the asymptotic stability of these steady states...
