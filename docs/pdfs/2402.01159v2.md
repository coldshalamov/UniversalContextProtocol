# UFO: A UI-Focused Agent for Windows OS Interaction
**Source:** 2402.01159v2.pdf

## Abstract
We present UFO (UI-Focused Agent), an autonomous agent designed to interact with the Windows operating system via user interface (UI) elements. Unlike previous agents that rely on low-level mouse and keyboard commands, UFO operates at the UI element level (buttons, menus, text fields), which provides better abstraction and robustness. UFO uses a large language model to perceive the current UI state, plan a sequence of actions, and execute them to fulfill user requests. We demonstrate UFO's effectiveness on a variety of common Windows tasks, such as scheduling meetings, sending emails, and managing files.

## 1 Introduction
Interacting with graphical user interfaces (GUIs) is a fundamental task for computer users. Developing agents that can autonomously navigate and operate GUIs is a long-standing goal in AI. Windows, being a complex and widely used OS, presents a significant challenge. UFO addresses this by focusing on UI-level interactions.

## 2 Architecture of UFO
UFO follows a perceive-plan-act loop:
* **UI Perception:** UFO captures screenshots and extracts UI element information (accessibility tree).
* **Action Planning:** Based on the user request and the current UI state, the LLM generates a high-level plan.
* **Action Execution:** UFO translates the plan into specific UI interactions (e.g., clicking a button with a specific ID).

## 3 Capabilities and Experiments
UFO is evaluated on the "Windows-UI-Bench," a benchmark consisting of various OS-level tasks.
* **Cross-Application Interaction:** UFO can navigate between different applications (e.g., taking information from an Excel sheet and putting it into a PowerPoint presentation).
* **Robustness:** UFO handles UI changes and unexpected dialogs gracefully.
* **Comparison:** UFO outperforms agents that operate only on pixels or low-level input.
