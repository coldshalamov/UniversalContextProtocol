# Asymptotic Stability of the Two-Dimensional Couette Flow for the Stokes-Transport Equation in a Finite Channel
**Source:** 2405.12166v1.pdf

## Abstract
We study the Stokes-transport system in a two-dimensional channel with horizontally moving boundaries, which serves as a reduced model for oceanography and sedimentation. The density is transported by the velocity field, satisfying the momentum balance between viscosity, pressure, and gravity effects, described by the Stokes equation at any given time. We prove that if the stratified density is close to a constant density and the perturbation belongs to the Gevrey-3 class with compact support away from the boundary, then the velocity will converge to the Couette flow as time approaches infinity.

## 1 Introduction
We consider the two-dimensional Stokes-transport equation posed in the periodic channel. This describes the evolution of an incompressible viscous fluid with inhomogeneous density. We consider a horizontally moving boundary and impose the boundary condition that the fluid moves together with it.

## 2 Ideas of the Proof
* **Linearized Equation:** Study the linearized equation and discuss the stability mechanism (inviscid damping).
* **Coordinate Transformation:** Introduce a linear change of coordinates to handle the nonlinear interaction.
* **Nonlinear interactions and Growth Mechanisms:** Focus on the "worst scenario" where the density gradient is at high frequency and density is at low frequency.

## 3 Main Energy Estimates
* **Time-dependent Norm:** Use a time-dependent norm with specific multipliers to capture growth during certain time intervals.
* **Bootstrap Hypotheses:** Assume control over a number of quantities (Energy Bound, Compact Support, CK Integral Estimates) and prove they can be improved.
