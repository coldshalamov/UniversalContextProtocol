# Hyperuniform Point Sets on Projective Spaces
**Source:** 2403.03572v1.pdf

## Abstract
We extend the notion of hyperuniformity to the projective spaces RP^{d−1}, CP^{d−1}, HP^{d−1}, and OP^2. We show that hyperuniformity implies uniform distribution and present examples of deterministic point sets as well as point processes which exhibit hyperuniform behaviour.

## 1 Introduction
The quantitative characterisation of density fluctuation in many-particle systems led to the introduction of the concept of “hyperuniformity” (S. Torquato). The main feature of hyperuniformity of an infinite discrete point configuration X in R^d is the fact that local density fluctuations are of smaller order than for a random (“Poissonian”) point configuration.

## 2 Hyperuniformity on Compact Doubly Homogeneous Spaces
The main purpose of this paper is to extend the notion of hyperuniformity to doubly homogeneous manifolds. We first give a concise description of these spaces and collect the relevant facts that will be used later.
* **Harmonic analysis:** Let (X, d) be a doubly homogeneous space. We recall the definition and characterization of such manifolds (e.g., S^d, RP^{d-1}, etc.).
* **Number Variance:** Definition of the number variance V(X_N, r) for a sequence of point sets and its relation to L^2-discrepancy.

## 3 Examples
* **Maximisers of the sum of distances:** Configurations maximizing the sum of mutual "chordal" distances minimize L^2-discrepancy.
* **Jittered sampling:** A simple probabilistic model for a point set X_N.
* **The harmonic ensemble:** Determinantal point processes provide useful probabilistic models for finding well-distributed point sets.
