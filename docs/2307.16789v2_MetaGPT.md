Abstract
Remarkable progress has been made in multi-agent systems based on large language models (LLMs). However, most existing frameworks often fall short when tasked with complex, real-world software engineering projects, primarily due to issues like hallucination and message inconsistency. This paper introduces MetaGPT, an innovative framework that incorporates Standardized Operating Procedures (SOPs) into LLM-based multi-agent collaboration. MetaGPT assigns different roles to agents, such as Product Manager, Architect, Project Manager, and Engineer, and mimics a software company's workflow. By utilizing specialized agents for specific tasks and promoting structured communication through shared documents and diagrams, MetaGPT significantly reduces the complexity of multi-agent collaboration and improves the quality of generated software projects. Our experiments demonstrate that MetaGPT achieves state-of-the-art performance in complex software development tasks compared to other multi-agent frameworks.
